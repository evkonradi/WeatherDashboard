If you enter the city name and click search, weather information gets populated. The city is also added to the list of 
selected citites which is saved to Local Storage.
Alternatively you can click on the city in the list that contains previously searched cities. This list gets populated from the Local Storage.

0 to 2: Low (green)
3 to 5: Moderate (yellow)
6 to 7: High (orange)
8 to 10: Very High (red)
